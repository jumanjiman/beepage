.SH DESCRIPTION
On startup
.B tppd
checks
.B :ETCDIR:/tppd.services
and
.B :ETCDIR:/tppd.users
for syntax errors, changes directory to
.B /var/spool/tppd
and begins listening on the ``tpp'' port (by default 6661) for incoming
connections.  If there are pages waiting to be delivered,
.B tppd
forks a child for each service-queue until there are no more modems
available.  As page-delivery children terminate, freeing modems for
re-use, the next pending queue is serviced.  A separate child is also
forked for each network connection.
.LP
The file
.B :ETCDIR:/tppd.services
contains the list of paging-service providers, one per line.  Each line
contains the symbolic service name, the phone number, and an optional
maximum length.  The service name must exist as a directory in the
.B tppd
spool area,
.BI /var/spool/tppd/ service .
Lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.LP
The file
.B :ETCDIR:/tppd.users
contains a list of users, one per line.  Each line contains a user
name, flags, the corresponding paging-service provider and PIN.  The
paging-service provider must be listed in
.BR :ETCDIR:/tppd.services .
Valid flags are ``M'' send email confirmation, ``K'' require Kerberos
authentication, and ``-'' nothing, a place-holder.  Lines beginning
with ``#'' are ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 20
.B \-V
displays the version of
.B tppd
and exits.
.TP 20
.B \-r
checks for syntax errors in
.B :ETCDIR:/tppd.services
and
.BR :ETCDIR:/tppd.users ,
and restarts the currently running
.BR tppd .
.TP 20
.BI \-M\  maildomain
specifies the domain for email confirmation, e.g.
.IR user@maildomain .
By default no mail domain is used.
.TP 20
.BI \-p\  port
specifies the port
.B tppd
listens on, by default 6661.
.TP 20
.BI \-b\  backlog
defines the maximum queue of pending connections to
.BR listen (2),
by default 5.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example of
.B :ETCDIR:/tppd.services
defines two service providers, pagenet and ameritech.  pagenet has a smaller
than default maximum page length.

        #

.LP
This example
.BR :ETCDIR:/tppd.users
defines three users.  Those wishing to page ann must first authenticate
with Kerberos.  Both ann and bob receive email confirmation when they
are sent pages.  Note that carol has the flag ``-''.  This flag is
necessary, since carol has no other flags.

        bob     M       pagenet         54321

The following example starts
.B tppd
on a typical Linux machine.  Users that receive email confirmation of
pages are addressed as
.IB user @example.org .

.SH PROTOCOL
The Text Page Protocol (TPP) is a very simple protocol for queuing
pages from users over the network.  The current revision, 1.0, uses the
following verbs:
.TP
.B AUTH \fItype credentials
Authenticate using method
.IR type ,
with the following
.IR credentials .
Currently,
.B NONE
and
.B KRB4
are valid
.IR type s.
The
.I credential
for
.B NONE
is simply the sending user's name.  The
.I credential
for
.B KRB4
is a hexidecimal encoded Kerberos authenticator.
.TP
.B PAGE \fIuser
Specify the recipient of the page.  This command may be repeated.
.TP
.B DATA
After the server responds with a go-ahead, enter the text of the page,
terminating the page with a ``.'' on a line by itself.
.TP
.B QUIT
Terminate the session.
.LP
Responses are similar to SMTP.
