.SH DESCRIPTION
.B beep
queues alpha-numeric pages to a TPP server, by default the hostname
.RB `` beepage ''.
The server,
.BR beepaged (8),
accepts page requests and later delivers the data to a paging service
provider.
.LP
If
.B beep
is invoked with only one command line argument or with
.BR \-m ,
all command line arguments are interpreted as
.IR user s
and the message is given on stdin, terminated by EOF or ``.'' on a line
by itself.  Otherwise,
.B beep
interprets it's first argument as a
.IR user ,
and the remaining command line arguments as the message.  Note: The
shell interprets the command line arguments, e.g.  !  ? * [ ].
Characters that are special to the shell must be escaped or quoted.

``you are both big losers, bob and betty!'':
